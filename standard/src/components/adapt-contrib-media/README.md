# adapt-contrib-media

A basic media component that plays audio and video. This component uses the HTML5 audio and video specification and has a Flash/Silverlight alternative for browsers that don't support HTML5.

The component uses [MediaElement.js (v2.13.2)](http://mediaelementjs.com/), a player with a number of useful features including subtitles and accessible (and CSS-skinnable) controls. MediaElement.js carries an MIT license and is therefore compatible with Adapt.

## Installation

First, be sure to install the [Adapt Command Line Interface](https://github.com/cajones/adapt-cli), then from the command line run:

		adapt install adapt-contrib-media

# Configuration

See below for notes regarding the component JSON.

### Component completion

The ```setCompletionOn``` setting controls when the component is set to complete, and accepts the following values: "```inview```", "```play```" and "```ended```".

### Closed captions

The correct ‘srclang’ attribute values can be found here: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp, `src` should be the path to closed-captions resource accepted by track tag (e.g. VTT file).

### MediaElement.js player

In the interest of customisability, all of MediaElement.js's player options can be configured via the component JSON.

The ```_playerOptions``` object is an **optional** dynamic object which can be used to set as many (or as few) of the supported player settings as required. See [the MediaElement website](http://mediaelementjs.com/#options) for a full reference of what options are available.

***N.B.** This feature is experimental; as these settings are not implemented by the Adapt community, there is no guarantee that all features and combinations thereof will be compatible with your device set up. See example.json for a suggested configuration that has been confirmed as working on the full range of Adapt's supported devices.*
