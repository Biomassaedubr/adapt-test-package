adapt-contrib-asessmentResults
==============================

A component used to display a single assessment's results. It can only be used in conjunction with [adapt-contrib-assessment](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt-contrib-assessment). Feedback is worked out in this component and should match the scoreToPass variable from the assessment.
